# SLGame-SEF

Ok guys, completely redone the git page so that all the files for the snakes and ladders project are up and running!!!

All you need to do is:
1. Open your java IDE and create a new workspace
2. go to the folder in your workspace in explorer(windows) finder(mac)
3. Create a new folder called SLGame  IMPORTANT!!!
4. place all files from master branch in there and open

To use github with your IDE...
1. Open your IDE and create a new blank project
2. Go to source control and create a new git repository locally on your computer
3. Link your GitHub account with IDE (possibly in settings or may not need to)
4. PULL from github repository
5. edit and commit changes whenever working on project


Cheers guys.
